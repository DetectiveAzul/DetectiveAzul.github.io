I think It was just a year ago when I totally decided I wanted to be more serious about the idea of coding. Don't get confused, I already coded from time to time then, mostly [small videogames](/portfolio/2017/10/09/always-go-east.html). I used to do it mainly because I loved computers and because a friend, who works on the industry, told me I could totally do it If I really wanted to.

That coffee shop was totally empty. During three months, I served a couple of coffees per week and, since I was the only employee, I had the permission of bringing my laptop there.

He introduced on my head the idea of **I** as a **Developer** and, because I got tons of free time on a very boring job on a Coffee Shop that only had one costumer every five days, I started to study coding to please myself, just as a small hobby. I passed most of my time practising with books and youtube series, *even though* on these times I **never** thought I could live of this.

But yes, one year ago I guess everything changed. A colleague from my job at that time changed careers to software, some friends moving to coding on my home country and, finally, a very toxic work environment that pushed me out of my comfort zone. I decided that Friday that I needed to swap and that I really wanted to be a Developer.


{% highlight ruby %}
def greet(name)
puts "¡Hola #{name}!"
end greet('Mundo')
#=> prints '¡Hola Mundo!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

'¡Hola Mundo!' is the spanish version of the classic 'Hello World'
