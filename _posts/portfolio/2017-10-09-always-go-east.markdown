## Backstory

The history of *Always Go East* is not very long, being honest. After studying for some month **C#** and [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) and spending some time creating very small games through [the tutorials on the Unity website](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) I wanted to make a leap of faith and try to create something serious while pushing me out of my comfort zone.

<sub> * </sub>One living out of it, not like me at that moment that I was still a newbie trying to understand the different uses of a basic *for loop*
{:.side-note}
After meeting another dev<sub>* </sub>and having some drinks with him and my flatmate we got into the idea of joining a Game Jam. The idea seemed cool, even with the stress of making a whole game in just a few days, and even worse, having only a few hints on how to actual code, except for our dev friend and main help on these three dark days.

Luckily, a month after that conversation, we found a spanish hackathon that allowed remote participation, [Talentum Jam](https://itch.io/jam/talentum-online), and we decided to spend a whole weekend working on this tiny project that was *Always Go East*

It was crazy, really really crazy. After three days, I was completely exhausted. All of us were. After a week of work, we had a weekend of work (that was the feeling, at least), but we learnt a lot and, more important, after finishing it [I was completely sure about my decision of becoming a developer.](/blog/2018/09/07/hello-world.html)

## Always Go East

<sub>* </sub>Two coders (being I one of them), a Gameplay designer (my flatmate) and the story writer and main artist (my partner)

**Always Go East** is a 2D top-view game made with **Unity3D** and written in **C#**. It was built on 3 days by a team of 4<sub>* </sub> and submitted as our participation for *Telefónica's Talentum Jam*. The game is about a girl that need to flee from her house because soldiers from an enemy country are trying to catch her and her family.

The game main gameplay is being able to find the exit of a labyrinth. The difficult came from:

* The camera rotates along with the player, making harder to orientate through it
* Lights are faded, making the level really dark
* There are enemies that will follow the character as soon as they spot it. One hit is enough to lose the game.

The player has two tools:

* A Compass, that always points north
* A hint, *Always Go East*, that reminds the player the exit is at that direction
* A torchlight, making easy to spot enemies and the level layout
