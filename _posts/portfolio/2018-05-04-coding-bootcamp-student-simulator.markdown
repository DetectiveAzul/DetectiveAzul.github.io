## Backstory

## Coding Bootcamp Student Simulator

This game is all about playing as a student of a *Intensive Software Developer Course*. With no money and no skill, they need to through the whole 4 weeks of trying to survive the course finding the perfect balance on their levels of anxiety, sleep, money and social life.

As *the player*, every game day will present you a situation offered by people around you. You must decide between the two different outcomes you must decide between two different outcomes that will affect positive or negatively some of your attributes.

<sub>1</sub>*Reigns: Her Majesty** is great game. You should totally play it! Seriously, try the game.
{:.side-note}

This game mechanics it is totally inspired and base on those used on games like [Reigns: Her Majesty](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devolver.reigns2&hl=en)<sub>1</sub> or [Unicorn Startup Simulator](https://toggl.com/startup-simulator/), but obviously tweaked to be a parody of my daily life as a [Codeclan Student](https://codeclan.com).

The tech I needed to use for the game, as usual, it was provided by the instructors of the course:

* Java for the Game Logic
* Android for the App
* [Android Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) / SQL Lite for the Highscores database

## Links

* If you have an Android phone at hand, you can download the demo from [its Google Play website](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.detectiveazul.codeclanstudentsimulator&hl=en_US).
* You can install an Android emulator on your computer and [download and install the debug build demo from the Github repo](https://github.com/DetectiveAzul/coding_bootcamp_student_simulator/releases/tag/2.5).
* You can look through the ugly code by visiting the [Github repo itself](https://github.com/DetectiveAzul/coding_bootcamp_student_simulator).
