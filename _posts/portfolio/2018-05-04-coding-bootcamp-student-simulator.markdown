## Backstory

On technical level, I think this project was the most challenging of all of my apps created during my time at [Codeclan](https://codeclan.com). Why? Well, it was a series of factor.

<sub>1</sub>. At the end, developing games was one of my objective for the future professional me.
{:.side-note}

During our [first Ruby project](/portfolio/2018/04/06/compendium.html) the brief we received about what kind of app we should create it was a lot more specific. There is also less decision involved on creating *a multi-page website with a database* than a Android application. So, even though It was clear for me I wanted to create a **game**<sub>1</sub>, it needed to be simple enough to beat the, always a constant in the course, 5-days time constraint for project weeks.

I am a full geek of boardgames, I recognise that. So I had for, at least, 10 weeks this idea of developing a multi-player version of one of my favourite games: [**Ricochet Robots**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/51/ricochet-robots). Something I could just play online with my friends in Spain, or with whoever had a phone or tablet and wanted to exchange some *mind-breaking* moments involving robots ricocheting through a lab.

But! But! It was too ambitious, or that was I thought the day before starting, so between talks and drinks, I came with another great, and I thought simpler, idea. And here we have our **first factor** on why it was the most challenging project.

### <center>I am my own enemy</center>

Yes, after ten stressful weeks of code learning, I started panicking. A wild *Impostor syndrome* appeared in the middle of the project and I lose the faith on the app I was building: *Coding Bootcamp Student Simulator*. A simulation game parodying the daily life of the students of my course.

So my own doubts backfired me and made me think that anything I was doing was worth it. And because of that, I made double or triple effort just to try to make it **better**, to try to be as good as the rest of my colleagues. And... yes, that was the **second factor**


### <center>I did not take enough rests</center>

<sub>2</sub>. Also I did not drink enough water.
{:.side-note}
After 3 non-stop days of 10 hours of stand-ups, planing, designing, coding and helping others to fix their code, I melted down. I got a fever, and I lose half a day because I overworked<sub>2</sub>. A lot.

<sub>3</sub>. Minimum Viable Product.
{:.side-note}
And, last but not least, trying to get too many features before ensuring the product was on a *MVP*<sub>3</sub> it was my **third fail**.

### <center> I did not focus on making a working product before getting additional features</center>

But I think these problems are the most valuable and precious thing I got from this project. I always grow overcoming obstacles, and I really learn lots from this very stressful week. I spoke with my colleagues, I verbalised my own fears, I discover the importance of a good plan and design and, at the end, I got to publish a very cool demo on Google Play.

Also, [I got interviewed!](https://codeclan.com/blog/ewa-jamie-martas-app-play-store/)

## Coding Bootcamp Student Simulator

This game is all about playing as a student of a *Intensive Software Developer Course*. With no money and no skill, they need to through the whole 4 weeks of trying to survive the course finding the perfect balance on their levels of anxiety, sleep, money and social life.

As *the player*, every game day will present you a situation offered by people around you. You must decide between the two different outcomes you must decide between two different outcomes that will affect positive or negatively some of your attributes.

<sub>4</sub>*Reigns: Her Majesty** is great game. You should totally play it! Seriously, try the game.
{:.side-note}

This game mechanics it is totally inspired and base on those used on games like [Reigns: Her Majesty](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devolver.reigns2&hl=en)<sub>4</sub> or [Unicorn Startup Simulator](https://toggl.com/startup-simulator/), but obviously tweaked to be a parody of my daily life as a [Codeclan Student](https://codeclan.com).

The tech I needed to use for the game, as usual, it was provided by the instructors of the course:

* Java for the Game Logic
* Android for the App
* [Android Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) / SQL Lite for the Highscores database

## Links

* If you have an Android phone at hand, you can download the demo from [its Google Play website](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.detectiveazul.codeclanstudentsimulator&hl=en_US).
* You can install an Android emulator on your computer and [download and install the debug build demo from the Github repo](https://github.com/DetectiveAzul/coding_bootcamp_student_simulator/releases/tag/2.5).
* You can look through the ugly code by visiting the [Github repo itself](https://github.com/DetectiveAzul/coding_bootcamp_student_simulator).
