## Backstory

Following on the adventures of hitting my first job as a Software Developer, I discovered that the learning stage did not finished along with [Codeclan's](https://codeclan.com) course, but that a Dev never stops learning, not a single day. Never.

_Obviously, at the moment I write these words
{:.side-note}
Nope. There is no escape. One of the first things I heard on July upon starting at my actual job<sub>_</sub> was:
<br>
<br>

> "I have been working on this for 20 years and I'm still learning"

So yeas, that confirmed my suspicion. But, hey, I love learning, so that was actually a good thing to hear. Why? Because that meant that, apart from my daily job code, I would have some time to spend on small learning projects.

And that was the origin of **xChess** which main function was to learn the basic tricks of _React_, but, since I always wanted to try to do some multiplayer game, I took the opportunity to make this very simple online Chess game to play with my partner and friends from time to time.

## xChess

<sub>1</sub>. *S*ingle-*P*age *A*pplication
{:.side-note}
As my first React project, and the first thing I built outside of [Codeclan](https://codeclan.com), **xChess** was made with the only objective of learning how to built a _SPA_<sub>1</sub> using _React_, although I also added a small _ExpressJS API_ to load/save games.

Using a few fancy buzzwords, **xChess** is a **React SPA** WebApp for playing chess powered with **Socket.IO** for network play, **Express** to handle **RESTful** routes that help the app to store/retrieve games on a **MongoDB** database and allowing multiple players to play multiple games at the same time, against other Human players or even a basic IA.

I have used some libraries to ease a bit the process of creating the Chessboard and integrating it with Chess moves.

- [Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/blob/master/README.md)
- [Chessboard.js](http://chessboardjs.com/)
- [Chessboard.js REACT](https://github.com/siansell/react-chessboardjs)

For the notification system I used a React Component available from NPM itself:

- [React Browser Notifications](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-browser-notifications)

And, of course, the more wide-known:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
