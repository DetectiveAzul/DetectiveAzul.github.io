## JaJa PubQuiz

**PubQuiz** is a vanilla *JavaScript Trivia Game* made with a *ExpressJS* server and a *MongoDB* database made by a **team of four** in a project week as part of [Codeclan's](https://codeclan.com) software developer course. It was developed following [Event Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming), with an [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern, a [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) server for storing highscores.

This game will create a Trivia Quiz for a group of up to 4 teams using the user input form on the app homepage. This form will create a link that will fetch the questions from an external API called [OpenTDB](https://opentdb.com/).

Tech Stack used:

* JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the front-end
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for managing all the JS packages.
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for unit testing
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to create the JS bundle
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) for the server-side

## Links

* [You can access here a live demo](http://pubquiz.devazul.co.uk) you can look at and play with. Since it is written on vanilla JavaScript, and was my first JavaScript app, there are some browsers that have problems with it, so I would recommend to use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
* You can look through the ugly code by visiting the [Github repo itself](https://github.com/DetectiveAzul/cc-group-project_trivia).
