## Foodie

**Foodie** is a learning project we have developed in order to learn the tricks and secrets behind React JS. In a few fancy buzzword, **Foodie** is a **React Single-Page** web application for fetch recipes from an API powered with **@Reach/Router** for front-end routing, **Redux** to control the app state and **KOA** to handle **RESTful** API routes that help the app to store/retrieve the recipes on a **PSQL** database. The basic idea of **Foodie** was to learn all this tool before joining one of the teams on our first job as developers so we could know the basics of the main tools they use.
