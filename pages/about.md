About Jaime, he was born in 1989 in southern Spain and, through a long trip that started with the end of a BSc in Clinical Psychology, he finally became a Software Developer in the summer of 2018 thanks to [CodeClan's intensive software development course](https://codeclan.com/courses/16-week-course/). Even though his main motivator to learn coding was joining the Videogame industry, he has discovered his *true passion* on reading and writing any kind of code, turning his hobby into a job.  

He has been lately working on *Ruby, C#, Unity3D, Java and NodeJS*.

One day a soft, cool breeze of a harsh winter found a warm and shy early-born sunbeam. In this strange meeting, **Spring** was born. So, on the first morning of an incipient change of season, **He** was born under the glow of two nightsky's princesses. He has a lot of names, but like everything in this world, He has only one *True Name*. But He doesn't know it and due to this, he is spending his *whole* life finding it.
